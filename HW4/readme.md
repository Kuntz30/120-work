This week was soemthing else!! I am submitting this a bit late, but still managed
to finsih my character. To make this character from complete scratch, while just
beginning to work woth p.5 was difficult! The challenge however was fun to takle,
and very rewarding once the finised product was achieved.

I struggled to get started on my character at first. Once i realized I needed to
use shapes to make him come alive, I hit the groud "coding" haha. There were a couple
things I struggeled with this week in particular. First, was getting the shapes
I wanted to the correct spot on the grid. Once I started working with the different
shapes, I began to understand how to manipulate the grid. Another issue I had was
getting my shapes to change colors. I read the colors reference page on the p.5
website, and was then able to manipulate the color of my shapes. Lastly I struggled
with the push and pop method. I watched two videos about the technique and that
helped me to understand.

I look forward to working more extensively in p.5 and too all the new things
we will do! I believe after this week I am up for the challenge.
