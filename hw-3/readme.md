#Week 3 discussion post
This week was another great we for a chance to learn more about atom and the
power it has! I had no idea what a p.5 image was before this week, and now I
understand how p.5 art is able to be published directly to the web. I really enjoyed
working within atom to create online art, because prior to doing this homework,
I had never thought about coding actual art.

I struggled a couple different times this week. First I had troubles getting my
first "Hello World!" sketch to display on my web browser. Everytime I saved my .js
file and tried opening my .html file in my web browser, it would be blank. After many
times of trying to retype and resave I realized that I was usuing the wrong .html file.
After switching out my html file with the proper one, my imaged displayed correctly
on the web. Anther problem I had was saving the correct "empty-example" folder into my
"hw-3" folder. I did this step wrong twice and it caused me major headaches to figure
out which file was the correct one to use.

Overall I learned alot this week both using Atom and Github. In future weeks I am
going to focus more on following instructions right the first time, to save myself
from future headaches with later parts to assingments. I will continue to become
more fimiliar with Github and will be ready for next week!
