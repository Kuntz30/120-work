1. Summarize the work you did this homework cycle:
*First I learned about the different types of text documents(Markdown,javaScript,HyperText Markup Language HTML). The reading described how they worked, and how different text editor softwares work with different documents.
*Second thing I did was learn how to use github and all its varying features. I learned how to track what changes I have made to my computer files.
*Lasly learned about different types of text editors. I downloaded Atom and learned alot of new unique features in Atom.

2. Steps taken to complete this assingment:
*My first step was to familierize myself with all the new technologies that were introduced this week. I did this by carefully following along with the course website and doing the exact step by step instructions.There were some times where i got stuck and frustrated, but I would take a break and then come back and would solve the problem i was having.

3. Did you have any problems or issues:
* i had some troubles getting my Atom download to finish, but this was due to the slow internet in my house. Also was struggling with some technical parts of github, but had my roomate in the class to help me through it.

4. Is there anything in particular you learned that you would like to discuss further:
* At this point no, but that could change the more work we do in this program. I have never really used a text editing software like this before, so we will see how i like it.

5. What issues did you help your fellow classmates out with this past homework cycle:
* I did not help to resolve any class issues this week. I hope that in coming weeks I can help more with issues, but need to get more familiar with the technologies myself.
